Count Words Coding Assignment
Write a program called Count Words that processes a List of Strings and applies the following business rules:
- Counts and returns the NUMBER of words (i.e. Strings) that start with "M" or "m"
- Returns all the words longer than 5 characters
  
Hints
- Make sure you implement this test like you would all your production code (Documentation, unit tests, build/packaging, etc.).
- Business rules change and new ones pop up all the time; how will you account for this?
- Please don't input words from standard input, no one likes to type long list of names manually.
